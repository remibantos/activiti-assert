# !activiti-assert - WORK IN PROGRESS !

This extension to [activiti BPM](http://activiti.org), based on [camunda-bpm-assert](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-assert) project, wants to make it easier to write tests for BPMN process definitions executed with the activiti process engine. 
For that reason, a set of **assertions** based on Joel Costigliola's [AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/) rich assertions library for java are provided, 
as well as a few little helpers to make it a bit easier to drive you through your process.
